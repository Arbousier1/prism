**Prism (Refracted)** is a change-tracking plugin for Bukkit-based servers. Supports rollbacks, restores, previews, 
wands, and so much more. Tracking so good, the NSA stole our name.

## DEV NOTICE

v4 is currently in development and not suitable for production use. Stuff WILL change.

## Support

Please be patient as I work to get this project where I want, establish documentation, build servers, etc. 

- [**Discord**][discord] - Please visit discord for help before opening issues.

- [Dev Builds][ci]

**Configs**

Prism 4 uses a different configuration format/structure. Options may not be 1:1 with new
configurations so please ask in discord if you need help.
