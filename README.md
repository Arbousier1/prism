**Prism (Refracted)** is a change-tracking plugin for Bukkit-based servers. Supports rollbacks, restores, previews, 
wands, and so much more. Tracking so good, the NSA stole our name.

## Support

Please be patient as I work to get this project where I want, establish documentation, build servers, etc. 

- [**Discord**][discord] - Please visit discord for help before opening issues.

# Rough Roadmap

Prism 2 is a relic from the ~2014 Bukkit era. There's so much that could be done better, so we're 
starting fresh with Prism for Bukkit v3.

- Convert command handling to better command lib
- Replace all database crud with a Storage approach like we did in Prism for Sponge. Allow mongoDB.
- Fix non-standard SQL issues, re-evaluate databases/efficiency stuff.
- Improve how hikari configs are used.
- Bring back Prism WebUI
- Move ore alerts, etc to a separate plugin
